	abstract = {The co-located normalized radar backscatter cross section measurements from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Ku/Ka-band dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR) and sea surface wind; wave and temperature observations from the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) moored buoys are used to analyze the dependence and sensitivity of Ku- and Ka-band backscatter on surface conditions at low-incidence angles. Then the potential for inverting wind and wave parameters directly from low-incidence \ensuremath{\sigma}0 measurements is discussed. The results show that the KaPR \ensuremath{\sigma}0 is more sensitive to surface conditions than the KuPR \ensuremath{\sigma}0 overall. Nevertheless; both the KuPR \ensuremath{\sigma}0 and KaPR \ensuremath{\sigma}0 are strongly correlated with wind speed (U10) and average wave steepness (\ensuremath{\delta}a) with the exception of specific transitional incidence angles. Moreover, U10 and \ensuremath{\delta}a could be retrieved from pointwise \ensuremath{\sigma}0 near nadir and near 18{\textdegree}. Near 18{\textdegree}; wind direction information is needed as the effect of wind direction on \ensuremath{\sigma}0 becomes increasingly significant with incidence angle. To improve the performance of U10 retrieval; especially for low U10; auxiliary \ensuremath{\delta}a information would be most helpful; and sea surface temperature is better taken into account. Other wave parameters; such as significant wave height; wave period and wave age; are partly correlated with \ensuremath{\sigma}0. It is generally more difficult to retrieve those parameters directly from pointwise \ensuremath{\sigma}0. For the retrieval of those wave parameters; various auxiliary information is needed. Wind direction and wave direction cannot be retrieved from pointwise \ensuremath{\sigma}0.},

@article{Valenzuela1978,
	abstract = {This paper reviews analytical methods in electromagnetic scattering theory (i.e., geometrical and physical optics, perturbation, iteration, and integral-equation) which are applicable to the problems of remote sensing of the ocean. In dealing with Earth's surface (in this case, the weakly non-linear ocean), it is not possible to have a complete and exact description of its spatial and temporal statistics. Only the first few moments are generally available; and in the linear approximation the statistics are assumed homogeneous, stationary and Gaussian. For this case, the high-frequency methods (geometrical and physical optics) and perturbation (Rayleigh-Rice), or a combination of them, provide tractable analytical results (i.e., the specular-point, the slightly-rough Bragg scattering and the composite-surface models). The applicability and limitations of these models are discussed. At grazing incidence and for higher frequencies, other scattering mechanisms become significant; and shadowing, diffraction and trapping must be considered.},
