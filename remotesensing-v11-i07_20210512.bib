ABSTRACT = {The co-located normalized radar backscatter cross section measurements from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Ku/Ka-band dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR) and sea surface wind; wave and temperature observations from the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) moored buoys are used to analyze the dependence and sensitivity of Ku- and Ka-band backscatter on surface conditions at low-incidence angles. Then the potential for inverting wind and wave parameters directly from low-incidence σ0 measurements is discussed. The results show that the KaPR σ0 is more sensitive to surface conditions than the KuPR σ0 overall. Nevertheless; both the KuPR σ0 and KaPR σ0 are strongly correlated with wind speed (U10) and average wave steepness (δa) with the exception of specific transitional incidence angles. Moreover, U10 and δa could be retrieved from pointwise σ0 near nadir and near 18°. Near 18°; wind direction information is needed as the effect of wind direction on σ0 becomes increasingly significant with incidence angle. To improve the performance of U10 retrieval; especially for low U10; auxiliary δa information would be most helpful; and sea surface temperature is better taken into account. Other wave parameters; such as significant wave height; wave period and wave age; are partly correlated with σ0. It is generally more difficult to retrieve those parameters directly from pointwise σ0. For the retrieval of those wave parameters; various auxiliary information is needed. Wind direction and wave direction cannot be retrieved from pointwise σ0.},
